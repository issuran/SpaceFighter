# SpaceFighter
It is a game tutorial, feel free to fork it and do whatever you want ;)

# What is it?

SpaceFighter is a basic game, where I gonna develop from scratch to playable game.

# History

In a space far far away, a brave soldier is looking for a way back home, fighting against aliens and all kind of obstacles that may cross his path.
